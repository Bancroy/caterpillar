# Caterpillar

Full-fledged **REST** **API** core with **Express** and **Mongo** written using **ES6**, **Promises** and some of the best practices out there.

This piece is developed in order to save dozens (or even hundreds) of hours necessary to prepare modules and solid base for REST API / Express server. 
JavaScript is awesome, but in order to build something useful and comprehensive you need to write a lot of difficult, generic code and pull many smaller libraries together. With **Caterpillar** this is not an issue anymore - everything is ready for development.
